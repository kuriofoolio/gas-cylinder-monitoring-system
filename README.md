## Arduino-Based Real time Gas Cylinder Monitoring System for Kenyan Household

### Background
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a widely used fuel for domestic and commercial applications. Monitoring the level of LPG in cylinders is crucial for safety and efficient usage. Traditional methods often rely on visual inspection of the cylinder level indicator, which can be inaccurate and inconvenient. This project aims to develop a real-time, user-friendly system for monitoring LPG cylinder levels using Arduino technology. 

### Specific Objectives
* Design and develop a system to accurately measure LPG cylinder levels.
* Implement a user-friendly interface for displaying the measured gas level.
* Integrate Bluetooth communication for remote monitoring and control.
* Implement safety features, such as low-level alerts and gas leak detection (optional).

### Tools and Components
* **Hardware:**
    * Arduino Uno microcontroller
    * HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor
    * LCD display
    * Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05)
    * LPG cylinder
    * Power supply
    * Breadboard
    * Jumper wires
* **Software:**
    * Arduino IDE

### Theory of Operation
The system utilizes an ultrasonic distance sensor to measure the distance between the sensor and the top of the LPG cylinder. This distance is then converted into a gas level percentage based on the cylinder's dimensions. The calculated gas level is displayed on the LCD and transmitted via Bluetooth to a connected device.

### Observations
* The accuracy of the system depends on the calibration of the ultrasonic sensor and the precise dimensions of the LPG cylinder.
* Environmental factors like temperature and humidity can affect the sensor's readings.
* Bluetooth communication range and reliability might vary depending on the environment and the Bluetooth module used.
* The system's performance can be improved by implementing additional features like gas leak detection or temperature monitoring.

### Conclusions
The developed system provides a reliable and convenient way to monitor LPG cylinder levels. By replacing traditional methods with a digital solution, the system enhances user safety and experience.

### Possible Errors
* Incorrect sensor calibration leading to inaccurate gas level readings.
* Interference in ultrasonic sensor measurements due to external factors.
* Bluetooth communication issues affecting data transmission.
* Power supply fluctuations causing system instability.
* Software bugs leading to incorrect calculations or display errors.
